What is it?
-----------
The Part 107 license is required for any commercial activities involving drone piloting.
In this case, Carnegie Mellon University counts as a commercial entity.
You MUST obtain a Part 107 license in order to conduct field tests for the AirLab.

Studying
--------
Many members of the AirLab have used `Tony's guide on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_ucCKFJUCU>`_ to successfully pass the Part 107 Test. 
It is less than two hours.
We recommend setting up a "study party" with fellow AirLab members and some snacks.
